	<h1> This blog is about everything I love about coding!</h1>
	<p> I <strong> love</strong> coding. Coding is my <em> favorite </em> part of the day, no matter what it is. Without coding, I am lost "in the sauce", as some people say. Being an epicswagmufter is hard work, so I refuel on straight gamerjuice to make sure I get my requisite calories.</p>
	<h2> To code is in my genes </h2>
	<p> I feel like I was born to code. when I was born, my parents told me in my crib:</p>
	<p style = "margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> <em> When I saw you sitting on that computer like a despicable fatass, I knew that you would be relegated to such a job as the sedentary and unimportant coder. You're a loser, and I hope that makes you feel bad </em> </p>
	<p><b> Thank you so much for the encouragement!</b></p>
